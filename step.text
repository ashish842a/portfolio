Great question! To **rebuild, push, and redeploy** your React app after making changes, you can follow these **5 simple steps** every time:

---

### 🔁 Steps to Redeploy Your App After Changes

#### 1. ✅ **Make Code Changes**

Update your code in the `main` branch as needed.

---

#### 2. 💾 **Commit Your Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update: <describe your changes>"
```

---

#### 3. 🚀 **Push Changes to GitHub `main`**

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

#### 4. 🛠️ **Build & Deploy to `gh-pages`**

Make sure you're in your project folder, then run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

> This will:
>
> * Build your React app (`npm run build`)
> * Copy `index.html` to `404.html` (for GitHub routing)
> * Push the build folder to the `gh-pages` branch

---

#### 5. 🔍 **Verify Deployment**

to check if your changes are live.

### 📝 Tip: Automate with a Git Hook (Optional)

If you want, I can show you how to automatically run `npm run deploy` after pushing to `main` using a Git hook.

Would you like that?


Awesome, Ashish! 🎉 Glad to hear it's working now!

Now every time you update your code, just follow this flow:

Make code changes in main

git add . && git commit -m "your message"

git push origin main

npm run deploy to push to gh-pages
